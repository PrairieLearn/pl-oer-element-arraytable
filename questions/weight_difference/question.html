  <p>
    This question is used to demonstrate how weights of different elements
    impact the grade received in the question. The first question below has the
    <code>weight</code> attribute set to <code>2</code>, while the second question has a default <code>weight</code> of
    <code>1</code>. So, if the first question is correct, and the second is 100% wrong, the
    student will receive 66%. If the second question is correct and the first
    question is 100% wrong, the student will receive 33%.

        Say we make the following changes to the array below, A, in order. What
        would the resulting A look like?
      </p>
      <p>A[2] = A[0] + A[1];</p>
      <p>A[3] = A[3] + A[2];</p>
      <p>A[1] = A[2] * A[3];</p>
