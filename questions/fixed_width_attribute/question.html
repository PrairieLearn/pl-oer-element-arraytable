    These questions help you understand how <code>data-fixed-width</code>, 
    <code>strict-grading</code>, and <code>partial-credit</code> affect how answers are shown and graded.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to make sure students input the correct number of digits (especially for binary or hex values), you can set <code>data-fixed-width</code> 
    to the number of digits the answer should be (after the prefix). If <code>strict-grading</code> is set to <code>true</code>, then they will be marked as incorrect if the number 
    of digits does not match. If it's set to <code>false</code>, the answer will be invalid and the student won't be able to submit it.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the first question, <code>data-fixed-width</code> is set to <code>3</code> and <code>strict-grading</code> is set to <code>false</code>. 
   (<code>unknown-value</code> is set to <code>"unknown"</code> and will not be considered when checking the width.)

        The binary numbers must be shown using exactly 3 digits (e.g., "001"). If the value is not known, it should be entered as "unknown".

        Enter the binary numbers using exactly 3 digits. Because strict grading is enabled, your answer must match the exact formatting (e.g., "0b001", not "0b1").

    This is the same question as before, but with <code>partial-credit</code> set to false. This results in all-or-nothing grading.
