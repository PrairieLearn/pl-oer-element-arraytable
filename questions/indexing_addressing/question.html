    These questions demonstrate how the <code>index</code> and
    <code>address</code> features work using array inputs. You'll perform simple
    additions at each indexed address.

        In this case we set <code>index</code> to be 5 and <code>index-prefix</code> to be<code>"$"</code>. Here we can see that the entire index row is filled with values starting from 5, incremented by 1 and prefixed with <code>$</code>. 
        This shows that when we pass in a single value to the index all the other values are filled in by incrementing them by 1 and when we specify the prefix it adds that as well.
        The array starts at index <code>$5</code>. Fill in
        each value with the sum of its address and 1.<br>
        For example, at <code>$5</code>, enter "6"; at
        <code>$6</code>, enter "7", and so on.

        We can also pass in an empty string to the index prefix to render the index without any prefix. In this case we set 
        <code>index</code> to be "" and <code>index-prefix</code> to be<code>"$"</code>. Here we can see that the entire index row is the same as the 
        previous question but rendered without the prefix because we specified the prefix to be an empty string.

        In this scenario, we set the index to be 101, which is 5 in decimal and we specify that the index base is binary. 
        By specifying that the index base is binary, the prefix is automatically set to 0b and the index values are rendered with a binary prefix.
        In this case as well, we pass in a single index value and it is incremented by 1 appropriately in the mentioned base. 
        Fill in each value as
        <strong>twice the decimal equivalent of the index</strong>. For example,
        at 0101 (5), enter "10"; at
        0110 (6), enter "12", etc.
