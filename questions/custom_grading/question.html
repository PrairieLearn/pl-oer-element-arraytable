    This question demonstrates how you can make a custom grader for the
    array-input element. In this question, the important indices that need to be
    modified are 1, 2, and 3, so if everything except those is correct, then we
    would want the grade to be lower than 72% (8/11), as the most important
    requirements are not met. This is handled via a custom grading function in
    server.py.

      <p>In this question, the three relevant indices are given 75% weight.</p>
      <p>
        Say we make the following changes to the array below, A, in order. What
        would the resulting A look like?
      </p>
      <p>A[1] = 10;</p>
      <p>A[2] = 5;</p>
      <p>A[3] = 6;</p>

      placeholder="[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]"
      prefill="[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]"

        This is the same question, but with a stricted grading policy that detracts points for incorrectly changing non-relevant values.
